I have problems getting the build to finish. Then when i try to re-run it it won't bundle or build. It just shows a white screen on my phone and the status of ready on the terminal.


Or if I could get it to bundle the build would spike fro 8% to +68% and back down over and over and you could see build restarts logging in the terminal and only shopped on hard shutdowns
